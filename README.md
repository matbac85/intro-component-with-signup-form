## Overview

This intro component with sign up form was developed as a solution to the Frontend Mentor challenge. The challenge was to build out an introductory component that closely matches the provided design.

## Features

- Mimics the design provided

## Expected Behavior

- Users should be able to view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- Hover states should be implemented for all interactive elements on the page.
- Users should receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty. The message for this error should say "[Field Name] cannot be empty".
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e., a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say "Looks like this is not an email".
